# PAID - Private AI for Democracy

We want to allow users to easily deploy their own local democratic AI lab, confident in their data privacy, while also joining a broader conversation about technology’s role in society.

AI tools that foster better democratic societies using political science and engineering principles. 

```bash

Technocracy: governance by technical experts.
Political-science/engineering fusion in AI

PAID (Private AI for Democracy) is a civic-minded, non-commercial project aimed at building a private AI lab infrastructure for democratic and ethical use. PAID is an open, federated infrastructure that individuals or local communities (chapters) can reuse and scale for their own civic needs. By keeping AI development privacy-focused and local, PAID strives to ensure AI technology serves the public interest – counterbalancing the centralized corporate control of AI that often reflects narrow interests instead of the general public good. This document outlines the repository’s structure and content, including technical setup guides and a dedicated space for the philosophical and civic motivation behind the project.
