# PAID - Private AI for Democracy

PAID (Private AI for Democracy) is a civic-minded, non-commercial project aimed at building a private AI lab infrastructure for democratic and ethical use. PAID is an open, federated infrastructure that individuals or local communities (chapters) can reuse and scale for their own civic needs. 

By keeping AI development privacy-focused and local, PAID strives to ensure AI technology serves the public interest – counterbalancing the centralized corporate control of AI that often reflects narrow interests instead of the general public good. This document outlines the repository’s structure and content, including technical setup guides and a dedicated space for the philosophical and civic motivation behind the project.

*We want to allow users to easily deploy their own local democratic AI lab, confident in their data privacy, while also joining a broader conversation about technology’s role in society.  We want to foster better democratic societies using political science and engineering principles to contrast technofascism with anti-technofascism*

```bash
Technofascism:
```
the wiring-together of advanced surveillance, data extraction, and automated control with an exclusionary, ultra-nationalist power structure that treats *dissent as a systems-engineering problem* to be eliminated.

```bash
Anti-technofascism: 
```
the deliberate design, governance, and ownership of technology so that *power is distributed*, rights are protected, and anyone can question, inspect, and re-route the entire stack.

As data-hungry AI systems, ubiquitous sensors, and vertically integrated cloud empires consolidate, the political cost of “fixing things later” rises exponentially. Once surveillance architectures, predictive-policing models, and AI-centred supply chains are locked into authoritarian governance, reversing them becomes orders of magnitude harder. The task, therefore, is not merely to deploy technology more “ethically,” but to build structural firebreaks—legal, economic, infrastructural, and cultural—before technofascism hardens into an irreversible default.


| Dimension | Technofascist Configuration | Anti-technofascist / Democratic Configuration |
|-----------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Ideology & Values** | Ultranational, exclusionary myths of rebirth; glorifies hierarchy and obedience | Pluralist, rights-based, inclusionary; foregrounds human dignity and mutual care |
| **Governance & Decision-making** | Centralised executive power, opaque algorithms, no meaningful oversight | Distributed checks and balances; algorithmic transparency, participatory auditing |
| **Tech Stack & Architecture** | Proprietary, closed, optimised for surveillance and control; cloud concentration | Open standards, interoperable components, privacy-preserving and user-controlled defaults |
| **Data Governance & Privacy** | Mass data extraction, indefinite retention, no individual agency | Data minimisation, purpose limitation, strong encryption, meaningful consent and portability |
| **Social / Behavioural Science Use** | Behavioural manipulation to induce conformity and fear; personalised propaganda | Participatory design, emancipatory pedagogy, community-led research to expand agency |
| **Political Economy & Ownership** | State-corporate monopolies; rent extraction via platform capitalism | Anti-monopoly enforcement; cooperative, municipal, or public ownership of critical infrastructure |
| **Security & Policing** | Predictive policing, autonomous lethal systems, secret watch-lists | Community accountability, proportional force, human-in-the-loop constraints, abolition of opaque blacklists |
| **Information Ecosystem & Media** | Centralised propaganda, disinformation farms, chilling effects on speech | Decentralised and diverse media, strong press freedom, algorithmic transparency for feeds |
| **Cultural Production & Narrative** | Spectacle politics, mythic past-future fusion, hero-leader iconography | Counter-narratives celebrating multiplicity, satire, open cultural commons, de-centred heroes |
| **International Relations & Supply Chains** | Neo-imperial resource extraction, weaponised standards, cyber-mercantilism | Cooperative standards bodies, tech diplomacy, cross-border solidarity networks, fair trade of data and minerals |
| **Environmental Sustainability** | Extractive, high-emission data centres; externalises ecological costs | Energy-efficient architectures, green procurement, circular economy for devices, climate-justice integration |
| **Legal Framework & Accountability** | Emergency decrees, sweeping secrecy laws, liability shields for state tech | Fundamental-rights-driven regulation, sunset clauses, independent courts, whistle-blower protections |

The farther each row drifts toward the left-hand column, the narrower the space for dissent and the harder it becomes to claw back democratic control. Confronting technofascism, then, means pushing every lever—legal, technical, economic, and cultural—toward the right-hand side now, while pluralist options remain viable.
